VAC bypasser is a VAC bypass module that blocks VAC from running. This could allow any detected cheats (i.e: OTC v3) to be injected to the game witout the risk of getting VAC detection banned.

What does it do?

Blocks checking process priveleges Blocks checking open system handles Blocks checks of process signatures Blocks interaction with any potential cheat programmes Blocks VAC from checking for executable cheat memory in itself and the game it is protecting Blocks ability to find processes loaded onto the system Blocks ability to find modules loaded into any process
